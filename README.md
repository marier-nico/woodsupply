# Introduction
This was one of the first projects I've ever completed and I've come a long way
since I started working on this. I might remake it at some point, but for now
it shall remain here as a token of my improvement, to have something I can look
back towards and remember how far I've come.

So, if you've come here to judge of my abilities, feel free to look at this project
but please, do not stop at this one, it is no longer representative of what I can do.

# What is this?
This is a system to retreive scores, and display them from the WoodSupply game.
